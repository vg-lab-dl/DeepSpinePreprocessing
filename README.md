# DeepSpinePreprocessing
This repository contains the code used for the preprocessing phase of dendritic shaft and spines.

## Installation
Requires **Python 3.6.8 or later**.
1. Download the current project:
   > git clone https://github.com/vg-lab-dl/DeepSpinePreprocessing.git
2. Install dependencies (from the root directory of the project):
   > pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage
First, the following parameters must be specified in `config.yaml`:

- `spinesPath`: path to the directory with folders for every dendrite to process. Each folder contains all spines associated with the dendrite in **.obj** format.
- `dendriticShaftPath`: path to the directory with dendritic shafts in **.obj** format. 
- `rawPath`: path to the directory with raw images of dendrites from microscopy in **.tif** format.
- `metadataPath`: path to the directory with metadata of microscopy images in **.txt** format, following syntax:
   > ExtMax0={X max}<br>ExtMax1={Y max}<br>ExtMax2={Z max}<br>ExtMin0={X min}<br>ExtMin1={Y min}<br>ExtMin2={Z min}<br>X={stack width}<br>Y={stack height}<br>Z={stack depth}
                                                                                                       
   > ExtMaxX are the bounding box coordinates
- `outputPath`: directory where GT images will be saved in **.tif** format.
- `joinUnconnectedElements`: flag that specifies whether to attach components or not during the voxelization process

**Important!** Note that files in `dendriticShaftPath`, `rawPath` and `metadataPath` should be named the same way as the corresponding spines folder in `spinesPath`.

To run the preprocessing phase, use the following command:
> python main.py -cf=config.yaml
